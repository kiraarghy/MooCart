# MooCart - For Moo codetest. 

##Design process

I began with sketching out the design as per design requirements.

Sketching out and making notes:
![Sketching out design]( "Sketching out App Design 1")
![Sketching out design]( "Sketching out App Design 2")

This was then followed with wireframing the app, inserting logic and finally testing. 

###Structure

App follows the following tree:

MooCheckout
  |_BasketContainer
  |  |_DisplayBasketProducts
  |_DisplayCotainer
    |_DisplayProducts

Components & functions are documented to explain function.

####Testing

Tests using Jest and Enzyme and testing basic functionality of app.
