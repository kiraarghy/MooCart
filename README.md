# MooCart - For Moo codetest. 

## Design process

I began with sketching out the design as per design requirements.

Sketching out and making notes:

This was then followed with wireframing the app, inserting logic and finally testing. 

### Structure

App follows the following tree:

MooCheckout
  |_BasketContainer
  |  |_DisplayBasketProducts
  |_DisplayContainer
    |_DisplayProducts

Components & functions are documented to explain function.

#### Testing

Tests using Jest and Enzyme and testing basic functionality of app.
